I'm Ronak. I'm a sustainable growth and marketing lover who's a fan of over-engineering things. I'm currently the Director of Marketing at [Lano](https://lano.io/), working on some great projects with an incredible team. I'm also a [MACH Alliance](https://machalliance.org/) ambassador, co-creator of [BuildYourDXP](https://buildyourdxp.com/), and building a [Developer Marketing community](https://marketingto.dev/) with [Jakub Czakon](https://twitter.com/jczakon/).

I'm passionate about Sustainable Growth, Developer Marketing, API Marketing, DXPs, and Composable Experience Architectures (MACH).

You can connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gunnyganatra) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/ronakganatra). If you're building a product or startup in the SaaS, API, or Developer Tooling category and would like to discuss marketing and growth, [get in touch](https://ronakganatra.com/contact)!
