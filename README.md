I'm Ronak. I'm a sustainable growth and marketing lover who's a fan of over-engineering things. I'm currently working on building [Savepad](https://savepad.app) - A collaborative SaaS for cross-functional teams to collect, categorize, curate, and reference resources.

I also co-run a [Developer Marketing community](https://marketingto.dev/) with [Jakub Czakon](https://twitter.com/jczakon/).

You can connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gunnyganatra) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/ronakganatra).

If you're building a product or startup in the SaaS, API, or Developer Tooling category and would like to discuss marketing and growth, [get in touch](https://ronakganatra.com/contact)!
